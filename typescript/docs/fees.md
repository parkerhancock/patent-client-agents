# Fee schedules

October 21, 2026. EPO fees were the first TypeScript fee connector and the
reference for porting the other offices in the Python `fees` package; USPTO
fees followed.

## The pattern

A fee connector turns one office's published schedule into a validated
`FeeSchedule` ([models](../packages/client/src/fees/models.ts)). The contract:

- **Closed vocabularies.** `category`, `tier`, `right` and condition `trigger`
  use the Python enums value for value. Map new fee types to the closest value
  and explain nuance in `label` and `notes`.
- **Exact amounts.** Amounts are decimal strings (`"1595.00"`), never floats.
  Parse the office's notation exactly or fail; never guess at separators.
- **Two dates.** `effective_date` is what the office publishes, null when it
  publishes none, and is repeated in provenance with an `as_of_status`
  explanation. `provenance.retrieved_at` is when the bytes were fetched. Never
  substitute one for the other.
- **Codes over keywords.** Where an office publishes stable fee codes, map
  codes explicitly to categories, years and conditions. Codes without a
  mapping still appear, as `other`, and are listed in `unmapped_codes` so
  upstream drift is visible instead of silently miscategorized. Keyword
  heuristics are for offices without codes.
- **Honest coverage.** `recurring_fee_coverage` is computed from the parsed
  rows: `complete` only when every expected renewal or maintenance year is
  present, otherwise `partial` with `missing_years`. An empty renewal lookup is
  authoritative only when coverage is complete.
- **Fail on shape change.** Validate the upstream envelope with Zod and fail
  with `INVALID_RESPONSE` rather than emitting an empty or partial schedule.
  Fail too when the source starts publishing something the parser ignores but
  that would change meaning (the EPO feed's `validUntil`).
- **One schedule per right.** Distinct rights get distinct routes even from
  one feed (EPO application fees versus Unitary Patent fees).

`FeesClient` ([index](../packages/client/src/fees/index.ts)) resolves office
names with the alias table generated from Python, so every name resolves the
same way in both runtimes. Routes not yet ported raise `NOT_PORTED`; rights an
office does not have raise `UNSUPPORTED_RIGHT`. Adding an office means one
module that returns `FeeSchedule`s, one line per route in `FeesClient`, a
recorder entry and tests. The MCP tools need no change.

## EPO

`EpoFeesClient` ([source](../packages/client/src/fees/epo.ts)) reads the
undocumented JSON feed behind the EPO Schedule of Fees app
(`https://fees.apps.epo.org/prod/bff/api/fees`), as Python does. One payload
holds both schedules:

| Route | Codes | Renewals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EP/EPO/patent` | EPC and PCT fees; 033-050 renewals, 093-110 late fees | Years 3-20 |
| `UP/EPO-UP/patent` | 701, 713, 732-750 renewals, 752-770 late fees, 771 | Years 2-20 |

This corrects the Python port in three places, which still behaves the old way:

1. Python's EPO schedule includes the Unitary Patent codes 732-770 as EP
   renewals, so an EPO renewal lookup for years 3-20 returns two conflicting
   amounts (year 10: 1865.00 and 1175.00). Its notes also describe 732-750 as EP
   renewal years 2-20 and 100-110 as IP5 fees; both are wrong.
2. Python's keyword categorizer puts "Fee for a European search" (002) in
   `other`. Explicit codes fix this.
3. Python's EPO-UP route is a static transcription of RFeesUPP Article 2. Here
   it comes live from the same feed, and a test checks that the live ladder
   equals the transcribed Article 2 table. Its effective date is therefore
   unpublished (null) instead of the Python constant 2023-06-01.

Percentage fees (123, further processing at 50% of the late fee) carry a note
because the feed lists them as 0.00. PCT reductions 316-319 are reductions, not
charges, and say so. Rule 7a EPC micro-entity reductions and the Unitary Patent
licence-of-right reduction are not applied.

## USPTO

`UsptoFeesClient` ([source](../packages/client/src/fees/uspto.ts)) parses the
HTML fee schedule page
(`https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule`),
as Python does. USPTO publishes no JSON or CSV fee feed; the only other
official form is the PDF of the same schedule, so the page remains the source.
One fetch serves all three routes, and concurrent requests share it.

| Route | Content | Recurring fees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `US/USPTO/patent` | Utility fees plus the procedural, PTAB, PCT and service fees every application shares | Maintenance years 4, 8, 12 |
| `US/USPTO/design` | Fees specific to design applications, including Hague | Not applicable |
| `US/USPTO/trademark` | Electronic and paper fees, post-registration, TTAB, Madrid | Renewal year 10 |

Every fee code is mapped explicitly. Patent rows carry one code per entity
tier (1xxx large, 2xxx small, 3xxx micro); 4011 is the small-entity
electronic filing fee and maps to `small` only. Rows with one code and one
amount for everyone (PCT fees to foreign offices, service fees, pro hac vice)
use tier `none`. Trademark rows become an electronic fee (7xxx) and, where
paper filing is allowed, a paper fee (6xxx) with a `paper_filing` condition;
combined filings join their codes with `+` (`7201+7205` for Sections 8 and 9).
Zero-dollar rows the page lists without a code are keyed by their rule
(`37 CFR 1.18(d)(1)`). Maintenance fees are due 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5 years after
grant and are stored as years 4, 8 and 12, as in Python.

The effective date is the one the page states (January 19, 2025). The page
also states a revision date (August 14, 2026), which goes in
`provenance.as_of_status` and the notes and is never used as the effective
date. A future effective date is reported as scheduled.

The parser fails with `INVALID_RESPONSE` when a section appears or disappears,
a column header changes, the effective-date header is missing, an amount is
not plain dollars, or a fee code is malformed. Fees the page gives only as
"variable" or "paid to WIPO" (1619, 1782, 7951-7954) are omitted and named in
the notes. Enrollment, penalty, Fastener Quality Act and general service fees
are not IP-right fees and are skipped, as in Python. Plant-specific fees are
omitted because there is no plant route.

This corrects the Python scraper, which still behaves the old way:

1. Its keyword split on "- Design" sends the design issue fee (1502), the
   Hague design issue fee, the design size fee and the Hague transmittal fee
   to the utility schedule, along with plant search, examination, size and
   issue fees. The reissue search and examination fees (1114, 1314) mention
   Design CPA reissues, so Python files them under design only and the
   utility schedule loses them. Here they are in both.
2. It skips two-code rows, so the third-party submission fee (1818/2818) is
   missing.
3. It files the Section 9 grace-period and deficiency fees as renewals at year
   10, so a renewal lookup returns them; here the grace fee is a late fee and
   the deficiency fee is `other`.
4. Its caption rules make every PCT national and international stage fee a
   filing fee, including search, examination and excess-claim fees, and its
   trademark per-class condition (`classes_over`, threshold 1) implies the
   first class is free. Here per-class fees use threshold 0.
5. It emits single-amount rows such as PCT foreign-office fees three times,
   once per tier, under one code.

### Cross-check

Amounts were compared with 37 CFR as published in the eCFR (title 37 issue of
August 26, 2026, fetched October 21, 2026): utility, design, provisional and
reissue filing fees (1.16(a), (b), (d), (e)), utility and design issue fees
(1.18(a), (b)(1)), the three maintenance fees (1.20(e)-(g)) at all three
tiers, and the trademark paper and electronic application and renewal fees
(2.6(a)(1), (a)(5)). All match the page and are pinned in the tests.

## MCP

`get_fee_schedule`, `list_fee_jurisdictions` and `lookup_fee` keep the Python
names and lookup semantics (no year excludes renewal rows; tier applies only to
tiered rows). They are registered unconditionally because neither source needs
credentials, and they require the `fees:read` scope over HTTP. The `get_fees`
facade serves USPTO by routing alone; it accepts `refresh` only for USPTO, as
Python does, and since nothing is cached every call already fetches the page.

## Verification and limits

`bun run record:fees` recorded both EPO routes live on October 21, 2026: 112
EPC fees and 41 Unitary Patent fees, no unmapped codes, complete renewal
coverage. It recorded the USPTO page the same day: 412 patent, 42 design and
113 trademark fees, no unmapped codes.
[Tests](../tests/fees.test.ts) replay those recordings and check specific
amounts, the 50% late-fee relation for every year, the Article 2 cross-check,
amount parsing, drift detection, schema rules, resolver parity, MCP filters and
the `fees:read` scope. The USPTO tests check the eCFR amounts, tier codes,
route membership, trademark paper and combined codes, single-fetch sharing and
page drift.

There is no response cache: each call fetches the source (the EPO feed is
about 23 KB, the USPTO page about 210 KB). Python caches both for seven days
and keeps a USPTO revalidation receipt; neither is ported, and the
`get_fee_schedule` and `lookup_fee` tools have no `refresh` input.
Nothing is deployed.
